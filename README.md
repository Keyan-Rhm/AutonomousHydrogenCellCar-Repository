# AutonomousHydrogenCellCar
The hydrogen fuel cell car is a kit which includes all the components required to assemble a fully functioning model electric vehicle, which is powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. These parts include:
> - Aluminum  chassis
> - MSP430 development board
> - 2-channel motor controller
> - Reflectance sensors and pushbuttons
> - Brushed DC motors, gearbox and wheels
> - Hydrogen fuel cells
> - Beakers, gas storage vessels and connecting hoses

###Project Goals and Objectives
The main goal of this project was to assemble and program a fuel cell car which would compete against other teams in a competition involving line following obstacle courses, system efficiency testing and overall design. 
One objective to assist in the line following obstacle courses was to design, implement and test a program which could interface with the onboard sensors to intelligently track lines and obstacles to complete the course efficiently and with minimal time. One further objective was to design a procedure for charging the fuel cell which would provide long term power output and efficiency. The final objective was to add additional features which would give the project a more appealing overall design.
